## Purpose
This document collects developer-facing details you will want while maintaining or extending the project.

## Repository layout (important files)
- `src/App.jsx`  Top-level layout, routing, theme and demo auth state.
- `src/main.jsx`  App bootstrap (Vite/React entry).
- `src/index.css`, `src/App.css`  Tailwind and app styles.
- `src/Components/Navbar.jsx`  Responsive navigation, theme toggle, profile menu.
- `src/Components/Home.jsx`  Landing / hero and feature container.
- `src/Components/Features.jsx`  Demo data filters (users, tourist places).
- `src/Components/Dashboard.jsx`  KPI cards, Chart.js charts, activity feed, GSAP animations.
- `src/Components/Login.jsx` & `src/Components/Signup.jsx`  MUI forms (demo only).
- `README.md`  Getting started and features summary.

## Key implementation details

Theme (dark/light)
- Theme state is owned in `src/App.jsx` (persisted to `localStorage`).
- The chosen theme is applied by toggling the `dark` class on the `<html>` element (`document.documentElement.classList`).
- Components use Tailwind `dark:` variants and component-level conditional backgrounds for MUI `Card` components.
- To add theme-aware inline styles, check `document.documentElement.classList.contains('dark')`.

Routing & demo auth
- Routing uses `react-router-dom` with routes for `/`, `/dashboard`, `/login` and `/signup` in `src/App.jsx`.
- A demo `isLoggedIn` boolean is used to show/hide menu options; to make routes protected, add a small `ProtectedRoute` wrapper component and read `isLoggedIn` from `App.jsx`.

Charts (Chart.js)
- Charts are created imperatively inside `useEffect` in `src/Components/Dashboard.jsx` and destroyed on cleanup. This prevents duplicated instances when the component remounts.
- Important Chart.js options used:
  - `responsive: true` and `maintainAspectRatio: false` so canvases can flexibly fill container heights.
  - Custom `scales` colors and `plugins.title` for readable headings.
- When changing chart colors for dark mode, update `datasets.backgroundColor` and `scales.ticks.color` accordingly.

Animations (GSAP)
- Simple entrance animations are applied in `Dashboard.jsx` using `gsap.fromTo()` on `ref` containers.
- Keep animations light; prefer animating opacity, translate (`y`) and scale for best performance.

Material UI (MUI)
- MUI is used for `Card`, `CardContent`, `Typography`, `TextField`, `Button`.
- MUI components accept `sx` prop for inline styling. For dark mode backgrounds on MUI components we used conditional `background` values inside `sx`.

Styling (Tailwind + CSS)
- Tailwind is used for layout utility classes and `dark:` variants.
- Keep global styles in `src/index.css`. Confirm `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;` are present.
- Avoid hard-coded background colors on root containers that lack `dark:` variants — these will block theme switching.

## Data & dummy data
- `src/Components/Features.jsx` contains `dummyUsers` and `touristPlaces` arrays used to demo filtering.
- Dashboard charts use static arrays for labels and data; these can be replaced with fetched data from an API.

## Accessibility & responsiveness notes
- Navbar now includes a mobile hamburger and overlay menu (`Navbar.jsx`).
- Mobile-first utility classes are used throughout: stack on small screens and use `md:`/`lg:` breakpoints for desktop layouts.
- For better accessibility:
  - Add `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls` to the hamburger and dropdown toggles.
  - Ensure the menu is focus-trapped when open and dismissible with `Esc`.

## Troubleshooting & common fixes
- Dark mode not applying instantly: Ensure `document.documentElement` has the `dark` class and that components use `dark:` utilities instead of hard-coded colors. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) can clear caches.
- Chart shows incorrect sizing: Confirm container has a controlled height and `maintainAspectRatio: false` is set.
- Duplicate Chart instances on hot-reload: The code destroys charts in the `useEffect` cleanup; if you add additional Chart instances, follow the same pattern.

## Extension ideas and next steps
- Protected routes & persistent auth (small, high value). See `README.md` recommendation.
- Profile page with avatar upload and persistence (store base64 in `localStorage`).
- Export charts (PNG) and data (CSV).
- Make dashboard widgets reorderable with `react-grid-layout` and persist layout state.
- Add data fetching (real or mock) and a realtime simulation using WebSockets or `setInterval`.

## Useful commands
```

## Notes for contributors
- Use the Tailwind breakpoints already present. Keep styles mobile-first.
- When adding new components that require the theme, prefer Tailwind `dark:` utilities first; only use manual `document.documentElement.classList.contains('dark')` when necessary.

If you want, I can also produce a `PROTECTED_ROUTE.jsx` example, a `Profile.jsx` stub, or add accessibility improvements (focus trap + ARIA) — tell me which and Ill implement it.
